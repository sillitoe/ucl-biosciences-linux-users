# Biosciences Linux Users @ UCL

This is a group for users of Linux systems in UCL Biosciences. We aim to organise regular
(but probably not frequent) meetings at UCL. The mailing list is available:

http://www.mailinglists.ucl.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/biosciences-linux

## What this is about

 - providing a coordinated voice for Linux within UCL Biosciences
 - encourage communication between Linux users
 - improve communication between Linux users and IT support
 - forum for Linux users to share ideas and promote best practices
 - forum to allow IT support to provide users with updates / notifications / training

## What this is not about

 - people using these meetings to complain about their IT support ticket

## Meetings

The plan is to meet up regularly (although probably not frequently). 

Details on all the meetings can be found in the wiki section of this site.
